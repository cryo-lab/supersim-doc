## What is SuperSIM?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are excited to launch SuperSIM :fire: ! SuperSIM is a *benchmarking framework* designed for evaluating neural network architectures implemented with superconducting Josephson devices.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tool provides **architecture-level** simulations and performance assessments, focusing on Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP)-based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architectures :rocket: .

## Key features of SuperSIM.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SuperSIM is designed for evaluating the performance of superconducting circuit, It provides:
- :sparkles: Efficient framework includes application, device for versatile **Configurations and Simulations**.
- :sparkles: Flexible architecture-level simulations for both single-bit and multi-bit ANN mode, various AQFP memory cell
 types, and diverse clocking methods.
(stochastic mode is coming soon... :dart: :dart: :dart:)
- :sparkles: Integrated circuit-level models to measure energy consumption, delay, and area usage.




## Who should use SuperSIM?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SuperSIM is designed for circuit designers, researchers, and engineers exploring high-performance, energy-efficient superconducting ANN accelerators.
